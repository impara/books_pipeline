Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental offers several strategies to enhance consistency between scenes and characters in text-to-image and interleaved text workflows. Here's how to optimize its capabilities:

Key Techniques for Consistency
Conversational Prompt Engineering

Sequential refinement: Build prompts incrementally using natural language (e.g., "Generate a side view of this character" → "Now show a back view in the same scene") to maintain visual coherence.

Explicit consistency commands: Include phrases like "keep the character and outfit extremely consistent" or "use the same character from the previous image" to anchor the model’s output.

Multimodal Inputs

Upload reference images (e.g., character sprites, scene backgrounds) to guide generation and editing. For example:

text
Prompt: "Create a photorealistic image of these two characters drinking coffee in a Paris café" [Upload character images][8].  
Combine text and images in a single request using the response_modalities=['Text', 'Image'] API parameter to interleave narrative and visuals.

Contextual Anchoring

Leverage the model’s 1-million-token context window to retain details across multiple turns. For long stories, reiterate key descriptors (e.g., clothing, environment) in follow-up prompts.

Use branching in conversational workflows to maintain continuity. For example:

text
Base prompt: "Generate a cinematic scene of a Porsche GT3 on a coastal road."  
Follow-up: "Show the same car at night under city lights, maintaining the same angle"[5][8].  
Editing Workflows

Make iterative adjustments via natural language (e.g., "Make her smile", "Change the chairs to red") instead of regenerating from scratch.

Avoid over-editing: Limit modifications to 3–4 steps per image to prevent degradation in quality.

API Implementation Tips
python

# Example: Generating consistent characters via API

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

# Initial prompt with detailed context

initial_prompt = "Generate a photorealistic woman working at a desk. She wears a blue sweater."

# Follow-up prompt for consistency

follow_up = "Show a side view of the same character in the same environment."

response = client.models.generate_content(
model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation",
contents=[initial_prompt, follow_up],
config={"response_modalities": ["Text", "Image"]}
)
Note: Use gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation as the model identifier and specify response_modalities to enable interleaved outputs.

Limitations and Workarounds
Face distortion: After 10–15 iterations, faces may lose fidelity. Reset the conversation or branch from an earlier stable output.

Text rendering: While Gemini excels at text-in-image generation, complex typography (e.g., logos) may require post-processing.

Multi-character scenes: Upload individual character references separately to avoid confusion.

For complex projects, pair Gemini with tools like Runway for animation or upscalers to refine outputs.
